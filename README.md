NASA's Navigation and Ancillary Information Facility (NAIF) offers NASA flight projects and NASA funded researchers the 
"SPICE" observation geometry information system to assist scientists in planning and interpreting scientific 
observations from space-based instruments aboard robotic planetary spacecraft. SPICE is also used in support of 
engineering tasks associated with these missions. While planetary missions were the original focus, today SPICE is also
 used on some heliophysics and earth science missions.
